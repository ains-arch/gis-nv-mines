# Mines and Water Quality in Nevada: A GIS Analysis

Mining is essential to Nevada's economy, but the impacts it has on the environment go
under-appreciated. In an attempt to determine to what extent the proximity of a mine has environmental
effects, specifically on water quality, in the state of Nevada, I do hotspot and correlation analysis on
datasets of mines and water quality. I also document the challenges I experienced throughout the project,
including an error even Esri can't reliably solve. While this initial analysis does not return much of
interest, the journey helped me develop important skills.
